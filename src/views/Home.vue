      The toolkit you need to get shredded

    <blockquote>
      Shreddify is a growing project which wants to give you the tools you need
      to get shredded. You will find here tools that will give you information
      related to both your training and nutrition. There is only a handful of
      calculators now, but as the project grows, more tools will follow the way.
