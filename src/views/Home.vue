    <blockquote>
      Shreddify is a growing project whose aim is to provide tools you need to
      get shredded. Resources you'll find here will help you with both your
      training and nutrition as well as supply you with required information.
      Right now only a handful of calculators are available, but as the project
      grows, more useful tools will follow.
